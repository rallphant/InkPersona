        <p>InkPersona is an interactive platform that allows users to engage in conversations with characters from famous literary works. Our AI is designed to adopt the personalities, mannerisms, and knowledge of these characters, ensuring that responses align with their original literary portrayal.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>We aim to bridge AI technology with literary engagement, offering a novel way to interact with beloved book characters. By combining natural language processing, personality modeling, and educational content, we provide a valuable tool for both casual readers and literature enthusiasts alike.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Our system utilizes advanced AI models (currently via the Groq API) trained on book excerpts and character analyses. This allows the AI to maintain in-character responses aligned with the book's timeline and the character's personality. Users can ask about events in the book, explore themes, or even discuss hypothetical scenarios beyond the book's ending.</p>

        <h3>Current Character Lineup</h3>
        {# Consider making this list dynamic if possible #}
        <ul class="character-list">
            <li>The Little Prince from Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's "The Little Prince"</li>
            <li>Big Brother from George Orwell's "1984"</li>
            <li>Ivan Ilyich from Leo Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich"</li>
            {# Add more characters as needed #}
        </ul>

        <p>We're continuously expanding our character database based on user interest and feedback.</p>
